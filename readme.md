# native-macos-digital-library

An (unnamed) native macOS app that allows you to view your Calibre library without opening calibre.

    <img src="./assets/images/hero-main-light.png" />

</p>

## Why?

Calibre sucks.
It's bloated, insecure, poorly written, not visually designed at all.

All I want is a set of tools that allow me to manage my library without frustrating me.
Calibre is not that tool.
